# atm-console-based-project

I’m excited to share my latest project, "ATM_Project_Console_Based", a simple console-based ATM system built using Python! 🏦💻 

### 🔹 Features: 
✅ Withdraw Money (with PIN authentication) 
✅ Deposit Money 
✅ Generate/Reset PIN 
✅ View Mini Statement (Balance, Email, Username) 
✅ User-friendly console interface 

### 🔹 How It Works: 
- Users can withdraw money if they have sufficient balance and enter the correct PIN. 
- Deposits can be made without a PIN. 
- PIN generation is required for new users, and existing users can reset their PIN. 
- The mini statement provides a quick account summary. 
- The system runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit. 

### 🔹 Tech Stack: 
🟢 **Python** (Core logic and implementation) 
🟢 **Dictionary-based data storage** (Stores account details) 

This project is a great example of how Python can be used for real-world banking applications. While this version doesn’t include a database, it can be expanded for more advanced functionalities! 🚀 
This is just beginning of what this assistant can achieve--an exciting step toward a more connected, efficient and interactive digital experience!
I’d love to hear your feedback and thoughts! Feel free to connect and discuss improvements. 😃💬
